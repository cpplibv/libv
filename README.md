# LIBV

LIBV is a library collection that contains a lot of reusable code.  

Feature development is mostly on-demand, but most library were designed in a bottom-top manner.  
Documentation is sparse, but for most cases the strict conventions and code quality should be sufficiently high enough to be self documenting.  

## Libraries

Most of the libraries in the collection are design complete and can be considered stable, but the collection
prioritizes research and velocity over stability.

## Install

The cmake script is not setup for proper installation of the library yet, only for development builds.  
To create a proper packaging I am waiting on the C++ packaging and dependency management ecosystem to evolve,
but even without fully adopting the whole library collection, I made it available and open source, so it might help out some.

Building the libraries is possible with the usual CMake method except 
during the first build the `ext` target has to be built to fetch the dependencies 
(This step is only required for the first time and when the dependencies change).
