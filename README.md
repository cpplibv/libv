# vl

This library is currently don't has a proper dependency checking and therefore the used 3rd party library installation is manual until i have enough time to fix this, the cmake will look the folders next to the vl folder for the following libraries:
UnitTest++
assimp-3.1.1-dae
boost_1_57_0
freetype
glew-1.11.0
glfw-3.1.1
gli-master
glm-master

I will fix this situation as soon as i can.
