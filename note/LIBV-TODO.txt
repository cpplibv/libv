libv.ui: consolidate MouseInterest flags
libv.ui: flags set in ctor -> parent might not get the relevant *child flags, check on propagation (self/child masks)

libv.control: AIA inside input ID is not a proper fit (!) blocking Analog input processing | I might be able to just ignore this one by two parameter | ignored with two parameter
libv.control: scale and impulse settings for each input source (and for global)
libv.control: Determine the correct scales, how each scale-er effect the final value (for simple and sequence case)
libv.control: mouse is not diff but position based atm I think
libv.control: mouse px is bad, use value normalized to shortest window dimension | both are needed: cannot change mouse sensitivity based on window or interactive area size without concent | mouse device px speed is the best solution | mouse px is ok if scaled
libv.control: mouse hardcoded scale
libv.control: Bind could use str instead of str_view, same goes for feature
libv.control: cleanup or remove input_table.cpp/hpp and input_id.cpp | input_id.cpp stays
libv.control: "2x4" to_string for sequence and combination | only name and symbol
libv.control: Query if a binding has actually feature behind it
libv.control: Feature register proxy
libv.control: Feature register, a limited API view that only allows registering features
libv.control: Feature auto-register solution to client global
libv.control: Auto feature register, without the backed in global variable into the lib
libv.control: Feature hash storage
libv.control: Sequence builder | invalidated
libv.control: Implement codepoint mapping observation
libv.control: What is the format for IO? Json? Lua? XML? Text? | Some very rigid text for now
libv.control: A way to quickly save and load bindings, aka binding serialization | Very plain text, bit painful
libv.control: Design persistence layer
libv.control: A way to quickly save and load settings: impulse, scale and timeout
libv.control.parse: Automated test for every input_id: symbol, identifier and name to be parsable | not automated, but a decent test, automation would have not saved much time
ext.x3: detect end of input, control and other parsers could benefit | x3::eoi
libv.control.parse: Mouse scroll without dimension should default to Y, update symbol table and parser
libv.control.parse: Mouse scroll should not require word_mouse | only if long names or mouse word are used so its not ambiguous
libv.control.parse: InputID scroll parsing
libv.control.parse: InputID parsing
libv.control: reorganize files
libv.control: Remove unused/commented codes
libv.control: Cleanup first lines in every source file
libv.control: Routing: Implement deadkey set single decision point
libv.control: Routing: Sequences dead-key like behaviour
libv.control: Routing: Idea: sequence can only progress to the next step if the current step is fully dissatisfied (maybe with the only exception to modifier keys, or a special flaggy thingy handwavey thing around dia); This would be the Netbeans way, but that does not allows holding down the modifiers and pressing keys and clion allows that | The Clion way is better
libv.control: Routing: Time timeout sequences
libv.control: Implement unbinding
libv.control: Cleanup binding_outcome and unbinding_outcome
libv.control: Binding storage (and active_bindings ptr stability)
libv.control: Routing: Select bindings based on more specialized
libv.control: Routing
libv.control: Scale in analog member, they should be scale / time / impulse, and i should use them
libv.control: Routing: record scale for entering active bindings | invalidated: killed button scales
libv.control: Determine the correct scales for multi type combinations | invalidated: killed button scales
libv.control: Scale implemented up to process functions, implement inside process and think about fullfilled binding
libv.control: List (into the paper) what is: global/per source/per binding/per feature setting
libv.control: Configuration and settings
libv.control: Remove debug trace messages, CONTROL_DEBUG, iostream, etc...
libv.control: 2 (+ 1) Example sandbox to presented in the paper
libv.control: Rename libv.control to libv.ctrl
libv.ctrl: Would be nice to merge keycode-codepoint-scancode events to a single pass | Its must due to sequence cancellation
libv.input: rename EventKey::key to EventKey::keycode
libv.ui: event two param, one for the component one for the event
libv.ui: Use an intrusive ptr like pattern for component internal storage
libv.ui: Common base class for event "host stubs" to handle general events (mouse / keyboard / component lifetime)
libv.ui: Provide general events for every component
libv.ui: Hide component parent management | thread local variable to hide UI* context in it
libv.ui: Idea move "real" component creation to attach time, removes the ctor ctx overhead | Cancelled
libv.ui: sandbox has some off colors that should not happen | the res white image was dirty
libv.ui: Hide component memory management: sp<Label> -> Label = magic<ImplLabel>

libv.ui: Clean up base_component/component includes with the new memory model
libv.ui: Remove every usage of std::shared_ptr<BaseComponent>
libv.ui: Fix typo: Travers -> Traverse
libv.ui: Autonaming should use per type indexing
libv.ui: align_vertical for string2D
libv.ui: align_vertical for string2D in pickers | Well, the algo was fool proof and it just works
libv.ui: container child anchor_parent, anchor_target and size are general concept and every component should have them -> eliminates child storage issues (for now) AND grid anchor_content is also here
libv.ui: property size / anchor
libv.ui.layout: anchor should be a general property, when a component placed somewhere beside unused space single enum which of the 9 corner should it use
libv.ui.property: layout properties: size / anchors (+padding) (+?merge cells) | can size + anchor be generalized? | yes and padding too
libv.ui: layout_line should support anchor | invalidated as the two alignment basically already solves the use-cases
libv.ui: property size / anchor access, and inherited property access | manual, it will do but for now
libv.ui: Rename BaseComponent to CoreComponent
libv.ui: Remove mask_watchMouse in favor of a single bool flag as mouse movement determines the other event targets
libv.ui: Improve layout pass 1 information channel: doLayout1 should use the return channel instead of member cache
libv.ui: broken layout with String2D with size = "100px, d" if text is longer than 100px, layout1 issue | main reason is that layout1 pass uses no limits (in string_2D)
libv.ui: implement parentDependOnLayout, reduce the number of layout invalidation caused by String2D edit
libv.ui.style: parent depends on layout invalidation could be introduced into the property as function test just like fallback | size is now a property and it maintains the parentDependOnLayout flag
libv.ui: text layout: rework string2D to not use GLR, it should be just a plain layouter, prep data into local buffer and provide span getters? | an alternative text layout was introduced
libv.glr: Implement sub-mesh API | it was kind of already usable as base_vertex, base_index and num_indices
libv.glr: Texture and Program base_ref
ext.x3: debug build x3 parser in libv.ctrl fails with an assert | the cause were the ascii skipper failing, switched to unicode skipper

libv.ui: move render iteration into the containers (to allow render state manipulation and clipping (?))
libv.ui: Implement basic scroll area
libv: Merge include and src folders
libv.ui: Auto set mvp matricies for the UI shaders | (?) | might not be possible | UI renderer took care of it
libv: Update every file first lines
libv.math: Assume T to be trivial and well behaving in vec and cleanup or update: decltype(auto) -> auto or T*, length[SQ] : T, , nodiscard, noexcept, etc...
libv.math: Remove vec dependency to glm, concepts should be able to handle it, if it must, or create bridge
libv.math.vec: inf, -inf, nan, -nan, zero: vector creator functions
libv.math: Add/verify structured binding support for vec_t | works for 2, 3, 4, not for the rest
libv.math.vec: Implement operator% | for floating point types it calls fmod
libv.math: Make every vec / mat operator a hidden friend | Is it possible or is it worth it (it might make 5 overload from the current 3 per operator)? | Moved everything that was worth it
libv.math: Create vec_fwd and mat_fwd headers
libv.utility: opt_ref<T> and opt_ref_none to alias T* | reworked optional_ref<T> to the same idea
libv.ui: update every component to the new renderer | (overlay_zoom uses glr, but its fine)
app.gen_ui_theme: App to generate and modify UI themes
app.gen_ui_theme: modernize to use libv.frame
libv.gl: more glewInit into GL

app.gen_ui_theme: Reduce the number of thread swapping during reloading
app.gen_ui_theme: Keep worker threads alive between runs
app.gen_ui_theme: Rename to app.theme
libv.thread: Rename to libv.mt
app.theme: add lua <-> C++ linked ui elements for float selection
libv.img: New library to handle image saving
libv.ui: verify: check if mark remove should be recursive | it is, markRemove does it perfectly
libv.ui: remove layout flag | invalidated: used to exclude components that are marked for removal from the current loop
app.theme: Improve SOW management
app.theme: Solve the event loop problem | in place, not really generalized
app.theme: box shape | solved with rounded box with corner = 0

libv.utility: non repeating random numbers: lottery problem, on collusion shuffle to back

libv.ctrl: "alterator_feature" (with better name, maybe mode_feature) -> only stateful, like hold shift to show more information | its kind of an analog with ignored value, but not really, and it would be nice to have state getter for this, and that would make it a binary, but with properly guarded
libv.ctrl: save xls from thesis archive



ext.x3: make sure that every rule is static, BUT ! What about static initialization order fiasco?
	libv.parse: move x3 parse rules to globals with internal linkage to improve performance
ext.x3: make sure that no header dependency exposed by libv parsers (headers)

libv.ctrl: clean up visibility (especially for Sequence and StateSequence and related types) cleanup distant member accesses (from control)
libv.ctrl: introspection API should not see stated types | info type proxies | maybe even pimpl
libv.ctrl: Binding binary operation setting and serialization

libv.ctrl: InputID, Input, AIA and DIA should be merged this way: both Input and InputID should be 64bit types, but one should contain the action related information, they should be converted to one another with extra info or info loss, inheritance or CRTP might save some work

libv.ctrl: More specialized binding can hide normal feature if there is not context under it -> the order of context existence check and binding specialization test should be flipped
libv.ctrl.routing: Unrelated analog event cancels button sequence
libv.ctrl: Feature collection is collecting empty functions too


libv.ctrl: Sequence: dead-key like behaviour
		process analog will need to differentiate between mouse and analog, but that is already needed for, or not, at least not yet, something got cancelled with this one

		if there are dead-keys active
			only consider dead-key set bindings
		otherwise
			consider every binding

		if a combination got fulfilled
			if it was a sequence's non-last combination or if it was not a sequence
				collect into normal list
			else
				collect into ongoing_sequence list

		select and filter (normal list AND ongoing_sequence list)
		remove elements from ongoing_sequence that were not selected
		broadcast among selected normal list


		if (not ongoing_sequence.empty())
			store ongoing_sequence as dead-key set and therefore enter dead-key mode


		when to cancel a dead-key situation
		if we are in a dead-key situation and any of the following occurs
				event: that is not part of any new combination in dead-key set
				event: not an opposite or holding of the previous history step of dead-key set
				on time: sequence_timeout
			then cancel dead-key situation by clearing the dead-key set and discarding the event




libv.ctrl: Paper
	TODO notes:
		Issue: Binding input sub sequence collusion
			Given 'Shift + E' and 'E' binding, inputting 'Shift + E' will incorrectly satisfy both
			Mistake:
				Assumption: Inputs are serial
				Reality: Input might be parallel (Throw grenade with Shift + F while WASD active)
				Additional note: Multi combination inputs are expected to be serial at all times.
				Additional note: Due to this, heuristic might be acceptable?

			Solution A: (heuristic) prefer the more specialized bindings (? based on setting of the binding) | causes issues with non valid shortcuts matching a smaller one
			Solution B: (at most internally) specify as the E version as not pressed: Shift [free] + E
			Solution C: modifier bits, but that would introduce the inability to define custom modifiers
			Solution D: per binding exclusivity definition:
				- yield toward more specialized
				- require exclusivity
				- ignore independent
				- allow non-interfering independent changes
				- allow non-interleaving independent states
				- ...

			Solution placement 1: controls settings
			Solution placement 2: per binding
			Solution placement 3: per feature

				Research required: both source and usage examples in multiple domain and programs
				Document findings
				Research required: feature based interruptibility matrix

			Additional note:
				Callbacks passed events could/should have an absorb flag. Binding and features could demand certain absorbs properties like only one absorb or allow subset sequences to be fired or allow parallel and so on...

		Issue: Need 2D input support (?), for example pie menu needs it too | that is UI absolute position

		Click - Press > at most X time > Release
		Double Click - Press > at most X time > Release > at most T time > Press > at most X time > Release

	Outside of scope notes:
		Issue: need a way to prevent scale above 1 on certain D->A time based bindings
			Solution: just a flag for the analog feature to clamp scale to 0..1 or -1..1 before multiplying with time

		Hidden features: option to register feature as non listable, but settable
		Hidden binding: option to register a non listable binding, but still settable

		Press type aka additional information on binding (AKA A/D converter):
			N/A, Continuous (Hold), Press, Release, Double click, (Toggle), etc...
			Threshold, Scale, Repeat rules, Offset, Ramp-up

	input sources:
		keyboard
			codepoint = codepoint resolution into keycode/scancode + warning on the UI unless it is part of the safe (A-Z0-9 and (?) more) range
			keycode
			modifier
			scancode = warning on the UI
		mouse
			button
			scroll
			move
		gamepad (and gamepad any)
			button
			analog
		joystick (and joystick any)
			button
			analog
		time
		events (API)
		context (API)

	input type (used for binding information)
		button - select state change edge
		analog (as joystick or gamepad) - linearization, deadzone
		movement - normalization px to 0..1

	digital input action:
		press   - input::press
		release - input::release
		repeat  - input::repeat
		any     - maps to press, repeat, release
		hold    - event on each frame if input is 1 (held down)
		free    - event on each frame if input is 0 (released) (virtual, disabled to due logic)
		auto    - maps to press, release and hold depending on output

	interesting usages examples, things to investigate:
		app.editor.manipulator.grab = Left Mouse
		app.editor.selection.move_x = X + Mouse X * 2
		app.editor.selection.to_upper = Ctrl + U, U

		half control - how would walk forward and walk forward toggle look like

			app.editor.circle_quick_menu.open = Ctrl + Space
			app.editor.circle_quick_menu.select = Click
			app.editor.circle_quick_menu.select = Space

libv.ctrl: Per binding decision of collusion handling by the user: priority, fall through, stop, stop if successful (feature can yield success or failure), call order, etc
libv.ctrl: In feature callback ability to reject the event/binding and allow the next candidate to be called
libv.ctrl: Binding profiles, and inheritance
libv.ctrl: Gamepad/joystick analog should be time related, but mouse and scroll are event based
libv.ctrl: Click and double click support would be nice
libv.ctrl: User should not be exposed to stated sequence (binding does that)
libv.ctrl: Idea: Stated and normal sequence common templated base class (?)
libv.ctrl.parse: identifier parsing (_ skipper or adjusting infos to match current parser)
libv.ctrl: Routing: Select sequence progression (beside bindings) based on more specialized

libv.ctrl: Integration queue:
	libv.frame.input: Add support for joysticks and game-pads

	libv.ctrl: review glfwGetKeyName http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/group__keys.html
	libv.ctrl: review glfwSetInputMode http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/group__keys.html
	libv.frame.input: Added glfwGetKeyName for querying the layout-specific name of printable keys
	libv.frame.input: Added glfwGetKeyScancode function that allows retrieving platform dependent scancodes for keys (#830)

	glfw.joystick: Added glfwGetGamepadName function for querying the name provided by the gamepad mapping (#900)
	glfw.joystick: Added glfwGetGamepadState function, GLFW_GAMEPAD_* and GLFWgamepadstate for retrieving gamepad input state (#900)
	glfw.joystick: Added glfwGetJoystickGUID function for querying the SDL compatible GUID of a joystick (#900)
	glfw.joystick: Added glfwGetJoystickHats function for querying joystick hats (#889,#906,#934)
	glfw.joystick: Added glfwJoystickIsGamepad function for querying whether a joystick has a gamepad mapping
	glfw.joystick: Added glfwSetJoystickCallback for joystick connection and disconnection events
	glfw.joystick: Added glfwSetJoystickUserPointer and glfwGetJoystickUserPointer for per-joystick user pointers
	glfw.joystick: Added glfwUpdateGamepadMappings function for importing gamepad mappings in SDL_GameControllerDB format

libv.ctrl: Implementation queue:
	libv.ctrl: Split analog dimension to dimension and aia
	libv.ctrl: Clamped analog (feature or control type that can only be 0..1 in a 1 sec time frame)
	libv.ctrl: Feature middle ground is missing: Input > Binding > Feature > Feature Instance > callback
				In other word: an additional type between the current binding and feature, this would clean up string operations
	libv.ctrl: Contexts information, state collusion information among contexts, use that for queries
	libv.ctrl: Idea: Analog/Action fulfilment hold satisfied for small time | SOLVED BY MOVING ANALOGS TO TIME BASED (also multi analog combination is no longer a problem)
	libv.ctrl: Identifier level to_string should be parsable
	libv.ctrl.parse: Quirk: Combination parsing bug on '+'+' would mean reverse order | Forward parsing would solve it
	libv.ctrl.parse: Quirk: Symbol ' has to contain an extra space because parsing error around + and ,
	libv.ctrl.parse: x3::eoi could improve matching, relax orders, optimize for most probably input
	libv.ctrl.parse: Quirk: word_plus and word_minus could have p/m due to the forbidden reverse order in mouse movement, test cases are required
	libv.ctrl: DigitalInputAction/(?)AnalogInputAction could be folded into InputID's reserved 8 bit, aliasing and specialization would have to follow | this would also fold InputID into Input
	libv.ctrl: Binding two separate additional information form | This is important, this is the core solution!: Input based, Feature based (and operation based)
	libv.ctrl: event/feature chain interruptibility on colliding bindings:
				add member to event: is_ambiguous
				add member to event: is_consumed and consume (or whatever it is called in ui similar event pattern)
	libv.ctrl: Invalid sequence automated fixup | only if there is consent
	libv.ctrl: In parsing Gamepad Button-s make word_button optional, maybe make gamepad selection more distinct
	libv.ctrl: In parsing Joystick Button-s make word_button optional if possible, maybe make joystick selection more distinct
	libv.ctrl: binding levels should be grouped primaries for keyboard or gamepad, also it need a way to switch them, maybe assign group or groups to bindings
	libv.ctrl: feature registration show provide way for custom properties
	libv.ctrl: hash based binding index for event where manually map everything to the most similar form
	libv.ctrl: why can I not x3::attr InputID directly (it just default constructs it and drop the value on the floor)
	libv.ctrl: More introspection is possible: search feature by context with or without name
	libv.ctrl: More introspection is possible: search binding with feature and sequence
	libv.ctrl: More search possible: search_mode::wildcard (with . as the level separator)
	libv.ctrl: More search possible: search_mode::any_word (with space as the word separator)
	libv.ctrl: More search possible: search_mode::all_word (with space as the word separator)
	libv.ctrl: Super flatten sequence and stated sequence
	libv.ctrl: check_binding and check_feature are algorithm that should be generalized
	libv.ctrl: Change in codepoint mapping can cause events with codepoint based inputs

	libv.ctrl.profile: each binding entry would select: inherit (noop) / override / extend its parent binding entry

	libv.ctrl: Idea: why not require codepoints to be inside the inputs events
	libv.ctrl: Idea: dia as bitmask
	libv.ctrl: Rep source type could be signed and analogs on negative, buttons on positive values
	libv.ctrl: Ability to list every (active) context
	libv.ctrl: Bind and profile api and serialization: override, empty override, append
	libv.ctrl: A serialization... A serious one
	libv.ctrl: Solve FeatureRegister code duplication with inheritance (FeatureRegister even could be a base of Controls)

	libv.ctrl: Context level feature containers, or index so lookup faster (?)
	libv.ctrl: Store more information about Context. Name, orthogonal and concurrent contexts
	libv.ctrl: Idea of context groups, and under a group there are multiple types

libv.ecs: Provide a component that has a special storage and can work as structure of arrays (SOA) instead of array of structures (AOS) to enable massive use of simd with a special foreach, so the general idea that share the indexing between tiny-tiny sub components
libv.frame: Move frames from disconnected monitor / off-screen
libv.frame: remove default own thread, give them an io_context like executor
libv.gl: templated buffer for binding
libv.gl: uniformbuffer?
libv.log: log thread naming
libv.net: Possible C++20 feature std::ispanstream would allow direct deserialization out from a received packet
libv.net: compression lib (fast, but not the best compression for me) https://github.com/google/snappy
libv.range: view::input_pass resumable range pass: auto pass = range | view::input_pass; for (auto i : pass) fooA(i) if (i % 2) break; for (auto i : pass) fooB(i);
libv.sig: merge back and place meta (too many tamplate argument) into libv.meta, (or dont, please, it is too many template)
libv.ui.layout: think layout as a graph instead of a stack..., just think and see whats going on with that approach
libv.ui.lua: https://www.wowace.com/projects/ace3/pages/ace-gui-3-0-widgets
libv.ui: (shader) Program Descriptor: program is defined by a descriptor (which can be identified with a simple string key), this could also be applied for the rest of the resources
libv.ui: https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-246
libv.ui: strong constraint: It has to keep up with 1000 character/sec input in mid sequence. Why? Because the 7.5cps is a reasonable high typing speed.
libv.utility: Make a proper copy-pastable noisy type
libv: LIBV_ASSERT, LIBV_DEBUG_ASSERT, LIBV_STATIC_ASSERT in utility header
libv: think about versioned namespace: namespace LIBV_NAMESPACE_VERSION { ... content ... } namespace libv = LIBV_NAMESPACE_VERSION

	online profiles / uri based profiles (if changes keep last N old versions, auto fetch on start)
colorpicker:
	- support all color space slider in one tab (all) and in different tabs too
	- support all color spaces, swatches, rgb, hsv, hsl, hcl with each 2x1 dimension change option
	- support auto relax color distances
	- support lua profile reference (?)
	- support lua operations
	- support multi color pick at the same time, mouse select, list select
	- support realtime result preview
	- visualize color distances, distance "bubbles"
	- visualize picked colors in sliders too
