output device selection: test if we use device ID and there is a change
	it stays with the device




soloud - still under evaluation!

	Works:
		ogg
		pause/resume
		other effects and filters: LOWPASS

	Most likely works:
		channels / mixing channels: I think these are called bus
		doppler

	Verify:
		test latency with the help of a sandbox UI

	TODO:
		output device selection:
				If I understand it correctly it is selected by the backend,
				that has to be implemented, should not be that hard, doable

		pitch change
			relative speed: yes works
			true pitch change:
			 		something something do with FFT

libv.audio: soloud: Switch from winmm backend to something portable
libv.audio: soloud: Add soloud to credits

libv.audio: Great overview on the requirements of a basic sound engine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEizUamJTyk
libv.audio: Idea: Choose one of N random sounds when selecting play
libv.audio: Paper
	For audio HARD API BARRIER IS REQUIRED (Every lib / backend is a shitshow)

	Backend possibilities
		Best solution would be audeo at first, but that will pull in the SDL chain, even if it is only used for audio

		OpenAL - License issue: https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft
		PortAudio - Too low level: http://www.portaudio.com/docs.html
			sndfile lib in order to load/save all kinds of audio files.
		audeo - Based on top of SDL_Mixer: https://github.com/NotAPenguin0/audeo
									https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer
									https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL
		soloud - Another good candidate: https://sol.gfxile.net/soloud/quickstart.html
			has many-many backend (even OS native ones), API looks ok, license ok (zlib)

	Sound
		Sound - What to play
		+/- Variations
		+/- Effects /  Filters
		? Other

	Play
		Sound - What to play
		Channel - What mixing channel should it be played on
		Operation - Start, Repeat, Stop
		Edge - Fade in, Fade out, Normal
		Position or Centered - For positioning [and sound delay]
		[Speed - For Doppler effect]
		+/- Effects / Filters
		? Other

	Option
		Center position - So play can use abs position and not rel
		Center speed - So play can use abs speed and not rel
		Channel volumes
		? Other

	Other
		ducking by over powering volume of sound
		ducking by over powering volume of channel
		ducking by importance of sound
		ducking by importance of channel
