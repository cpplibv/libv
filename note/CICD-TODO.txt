CI/CD - Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery







git: Commit count up to a revision: git rev-list --count HEAD


CI/CD:
	jenkins: pull
	jenkins: build (parameterized with branch and version number (and git commit count))
	jenkins: package
	jenkins: ssh upload the release package to the update master
	jenkins: trigger the update master
	update-master: by default every release marked as internal
	update-master: on some GUI mark this release not internal and mark update routes to be built
	jenkins could ping update-master on build start (option to auto release feature)
