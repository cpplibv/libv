!!! libv.serial: For safety the only change I should do for now, is get rid of reserves / resizes in serializers
		This includes every:
		cereal/types
		libv/serial/types
		libv/utility/entity/entity_ptr_serial
		any *_serial file that serializes a size_type






place.it: auto update could be assisted with the application main being in a dll? with a skeleton.exe

libv.update: Resource Client
	Single file download: Partial download recovery IDEA of an alternative approach would be to only write out the progress meta data every X seconds

	Server connections and task coordination:
		measure each connection
		if

	File download and saving process:
		Check if 'file.temp' exits
		if exits
			Open 'file.temp'
			Replay meta info onto the in-memory state
			If a separator byte is missing or corrupt stop and dont include its record
				Remove corrupted meta info from end of file
		else
			Open 'file.temp'

		Write data chunk into place
		Write chunk offset and size to meta data at the end of the file
		Remove meta data
		Close file
		Calculate and verify checksum
		if valid
			Rename 'file.temp' to 'file'
		else
			Remove 'file.temp'
			Start again

libv.update: weed out the legacy codes related to file downloading
	I think the best ones are in libv/update/resource/resource_server
	and the correct pattern will be in sandbox_update_main (or sandbox_net_main)
	| The libv/update/resource/update_client is marked for death
	| Almost done


libv.update: Cleanup dirty progress (mostly update server)
libv.update: Net installer versions, aka "version 0" (which btw is a moving target)

libv.net: Possible bug: In connection and acceptor io_context.post might not obey strand requirements
libv.net: Add support for endpoint access in mtcp on_accept (passing other type than io_context might be the solution)
			| This is important, IP bans could be implemented this way
			| ? But be careful, endpoints are only set with the connect call


libv.update: PAPER
	Update file name
		{program}-{variant}-{target}-{source}.update
		program-variant-01-00.update
		parsing from the back should be possible

	Updating:
		// Legacy stuff
		//
		// */**
		// */**.new
		// */**.old
		// .update/program-variant-target-source.update
		// .update/meta
		// .lock
		// program
		//
		//	update outcomes:
		//		failure - operation failure
		//			attempt to retry and continue
		//			rollback -> do nothing
		//			rollback -> fix corruption -> do nothing
		//			rollback -> fix corruption -> update again
		//			force apply -> fix corruption
		//		failure - corruption
		//			rollback -> do nothing
		//			rollback -> fix corruption -> do nothing
		//			rollback -> fix corruption -> update again
		//			force apply -> fix corruption
		//		success

	Resource ID:
        app.update::variant::patch::{filename}
                  ^^       ^^     ^^ separators
                                    ^^^^^^^^^^ filename template
                             ^^^^^ resource namespace
                    ^^^^^^^ program variant (dev, daily, experimental, stable)
        ^^^^^^^^^^ program / program url
        OR Just have something more custom and simpler:
			app.update/variant/patch/{filename}
        OR namespace and file separately:
			app.update/variant/patch
			{filename}

libv.net: Fix that the read/write limit currently cannot be used before the connect_* calls
libv.net: IDEA that in the connection instead of forcing the handle of an incoming message place it into the queue that can be accessed in the callbacks
			| This behaviour could be configurable with ctor flags
			| This would allow change of connection handle type
			| But there are other option like special call in the handler
				| connection.convert_to<different_handler>()
					| .differ_to<>()
					| .handle_as<>()
					| both different_handler.on_connect and optionally the "same" on_receive will be called on the new type
				| And this is the perfect solution

libv.serial: Optimization: Go template archives for the streams instead of libv::bytes_io, performance matters in that code
libv.serial: Codec and Protocol: if handler is not invocable with function, do error mechanism with if constexpr

libv.net: on_disconnect shall receive the first error that occurred which resulted in the disconnect if there was any

app.update: Create a sandbox that flips version A->B B->A upon each start

	app.update: Upon patch apply failure, create manifest and send to server


app.update: Paper
		Version manifest:
			list of files with MD5 hash in a folder
		Patch manifest:
			list of changes add/delete/(replace)/modify/rename

		The update process:
			prep
				create release
				server side create diff from
					folder/release A
					folder/release B
				save diff into patch folder with relevant information
				sign the update
			update
				download update
				verify update signature
				copy update.exe to update.exe.new
				apply diff to update.exe.new
				rename update.exe to update.exe.old
				// <- This is the only bricking point is here, and even then .old could be renamed by hand
				rename update.exe.new to update.exe
				restart update.exe
				remove update.exe.old


update: Sometimes it might require a restart for the updater
	- migration code is introduced -> need restart to run it, and only after that can the updater continue
	- updater is updated -> needs restart
		| with that we might enter the dual process updater world

		migration can effect saves, options, configs, profiles or even DB, or install settings or other OS integration stuff
		most of these are resource based so migration happen on demand but some dont (like os)
		so therefore the best option is if the updater code (leaves a patch previous version info behind) returns the prev version

libv.net, libv.utility, app.update: stream read https://quick-bench.com/q/idbivSAx2upsgoXQQgIPhmsBIJU
		| but the fastest is a local stack buffer of ~16KB that is filled and processed in a loop

app.update.security: libv.serial secure container sizes
app.update.security:
	! must authenticate the server (optional if the patch or patch manifest can be verified by the next step)
	! must sign and verify any downloaded content

	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11580944/client-to-server-authentication-in-c-using-sockets
		The client connects to the server, sending in the user-name (but not password)
		The server responds by sending out unique random number
		The client encrypts that random number using the hash of their password as the key
		The client sends the encrypted random number to the server
		The server encrypts the random number with the correct hash of the user's password
		The server compares the two encrypted random numbers
