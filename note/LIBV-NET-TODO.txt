libv.diff: make sure every stream input respects offset (?) | for output it makes sense, but for input I need the end of it | Done with byte streams
libv.hash: Generate md5 hash from file without needing to handle the istream
libv.update: patch create folder
libv.update: patch remove folder
libv.update: Patch apply progress report
libv.update: Patch improved logging
libv.state: Find a state machine solution | for now boost statechart will be good enough
libv.mt: pimpl worker_thread_pool and worker_thread
libv.mt: common base queue for worker_thread_pool and worker_thread only difference is "run" calls (?)
libv.mt: Add load function argument support for async_value
ext: pulled in cppcoro, but need to work around cmake issue of WIN32 branching in lib
ext: fork cppcoro to fix build issues
libv.net: Implement new network handler based connection and acceptor
libv.net: Implement sandbox chat server / session / client in libv_net_main.cpp
libv: fix typo SERIALIAZTION -> SERIALIZATION
libv.serialization: Rename libv.serialization to libv.serial
libv.serialization: Rename SERIALIZATION to SERIAL
libv.algorithm: Rename libv.algorithm to libv.algo
libv: Result only types should be marked nodiscard

salvage simple_server | resource stuff in it should be useful

libv.net: on_disconnect shall receive the first error that occurred which resulted in the disconnect if there was any



libv.update.master Separate master sources and dependencies to a separate lib
libv.update.common Separate common sources and dependencies to a separate lib
libv.update.client Separate client sources and dependencies to a separate lib
libv.update.server Separate server sources and dependencies to a separate lib

libv.update: (?) patch apply progress ratio getter
libv.update: (?) for updater progress made callback

libv.update: Patch apply current step report (API to get the next step/operation)
libv.update: Patch creation rename support
libv.update: Patch creation modify to support

Update:
	app.update: Implement an update server / client
		app.update: Reconnect: attempts, timers

		app.update: Security: Scope restriction on file access
		app.update: Login
		app.update: Server: Cache files in memory, watch if they change

		app.update: Manifest, versions, etc...
		app.update: List current clients on Server

		app.update: Sign the patch (server auth is not needed for now, signing is enough)

				https://gist.github.com/irbull/08339ddcd5686f509e9826964b17bb59

	app.update: Upon patch apply failure, create manifest and send to server


app.update: Paper
		Version manifest:
			list of files with MD5 hash in a folder
		Patch manifest:
			list of changes add/delete/(replace)/modify/rename

		The update process:
			prep
				create release
				server side create diff from
					folder/release A
					folder/release B
				save diff into patch folder with relevant information
				sign the update
			update
				download update
				verify update signature
				copy update.exe to update.exe.new
				apply diff to update.exe.new
				rename update.exe to update.exe.old
				// <- This is the only bricking point is here, and even then .old could be renamed by hand
				rename update.exe.new to update.exe
				restart update.exe
				remove update.exe.old

update: Sometimes it might require a restart for the updater
	- migration code is introduced -> need restart to run it, and only after that can the updater continue
	- updater is updated -> needs restart
		| with that we might enter the dual process updater world

		migration can effect saves, options, configs, profiles or even DB, or install settings or other OS integration stuff
		most of these are resource based so migration happen on demand but some dont (like os)
		so therefore the best option is if the updater code (leaves a patch previous version info behind) returns the prev version

	libv.serial: ideas for limited container size during serialization:
			std::string resource;
			libv::serial::limited<std::string, 256> resource;
			template <typename Archive> inline void serialize(Archive& ar) {
				ar & LIBV_NVP(resource);
				LIBV_NVP(ar, resource);
				ar.limited(resource, "resource", 256);
				ar.limited(LIBV_NVP(resource), 256);
			}

cpp: if tellg fails it can return -1, review EVERY usage of it

libv.net, libv.utility, app.update: stream read https://quick-bench.com/q/idbivSAx2upsgoXQQgIPhmsBIJU
		| but the fastest is a local stack buffer of ~16KB that is filled and processed in a loop


Network:
	I could do this when resolving:
	udp::resolver::query query(udp::v4(), response[0], response[1]);
							   ^^^^^^^^^

	libv.net.mtcp: Protocol messages, handshake with protocol ID and version
		libv.net.mtcp: Symmetric transfer rate limiting (requires storing local and remote limit, use min) (requires protocol message)


app.update.security: libv.serial secure container sizes
app.update.security:
	! must authenticate the server (optional if the patch or patch manifest can be verified by the next step)
	! must sign and verify any downloaded content

	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11580944/client-to-server-authentication-in-c-using-sockets
		The client connects to the server, sending in the user-name (but not password)
		The server responds by sending out unique random number
		The client encrypts that random number using the hash of their password as the key
		The client sends the encrypted random number to the server
		The server encrypts the random number with the correct hash of the user's password
		The server compares the two encrypted random numbers

libv.mt: worker_thread_pool and worker_thread, solve the next index loop around problem
libv.utility: usage_ptr: A shared_ptr that runs code upon 0 or 1 external reference remaining
libv.utility: input bytes on static memory should return correct amount of read bytes (required for hash_md5)
libv.net.mtcp: Idea of channel: open, close, receive, send, error, so a connection within a connection
