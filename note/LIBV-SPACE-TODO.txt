Space - System integration demo

libv.rev: Implement shader management
app.space: Improve arrow with geometry shader
app.space: Add grid
visual.grid: Make a pretty grid: Blender grid is awesome. Implement it:
visual.grid: For grids expand and fade out line endings
visual.grid: For grids fade out lines based on ray incident angle, lines should fade into the sky-box as seamlessly as possible
visual.grid: For grids fade out small lines based on distance from the camera and make higher grid lines more visible
visual.editor_bg: Non uniform color, use a grainy texture (like blue noise)
app.space: Move origin gizmo into top right corner into screen space
app.space: Burn a frame icon set into the binary and use it
app.space: Have space working from the correct dir
app.space: Screen picker integration - Place something onto the 3D world on mouse click
app.space: Fleet that moves (without any arrow)
app.space: Cleanup the shader error overlay code (PanelStatusLog + UIEventHub)
app.space: Sim state manipulation only with commands
app.space: Fleet with arrow and movement toward target (primitive)
app.space: Add support for command arrow 'intent' (color) specification
app.space: Revive the original debug arrow spiral
app.space: Implement a more complete test arrow set (parallel, different length, star, spiral, rings, multiple chains with different rotation angles)
app.space: Add support for command arrow animation offset
app.space: Add support for chained command arrows
app.space: Basic hacky networking
libv.ui: Add overlay events to the global events, then use those to alter controls input ignore (attach can auto do this)
app.space: Cannibalize style.lua from vm4_viewer
app.space: Rename player -> user (and the ID, and the members vars in CTOs)
app.space.net: Networking (Stage 2)
app.space.net: Introduction with name, Protocol messages
app.space.net: Lobby with list of connected clients
app.space.net: Implement lobby snapshot sending/loading on connect
app.space: Solve canvas and ui ctrl conflict
app.space: Commands have a conflicting name, resolve it with an acronym like CTO (Command Transfer Object)
app.space: Structure the whole program: UML time is upon us | Still not the cleanest, but improved


































--- STACK ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------











app.space: Move cto.apply(universe) -> universe.apply(cto)
		this creates a pattern with lobby.apply(cto) (and others in future)
		visibility will make sense, no forced public on everything
		const / non-const access will make sense, ability to control to everything only have non-const access
app.space: F1 menu, list every keybind
app.space: Rename files *_behaviour -> *_control
app.space: Move canvas and camera under view






app.space.net: Networking
	app.space.net: Networking (Stage 3)

			app.space.net: Snapshot loading
		app.space.net: Smooth Snapshot
			app.space.net: Non paused snapshot join
				app.space.net: Fast forwarding after a snapshot loading happened
				app.space.net: Apply, update, skip render repeat until catch up
			app.space.net: [Optional] Snapshot delta to help catchup

	app.space.net: Networking (Stage 4)
		app.space.net: Deterministic execution (Frame Index and lockstep)
		app.space.net: Latency prediction
		app.space.net: Latency hiding

	app.space.net: Networking leftovers
		app.space.net: Timer to kick "connectings" after X sec if they dont identify (Intro) themselves
		app.space.net: Implement lobby status event
		app.space.net: Implement lobby chat message event
		app.space: Mini canvas show other clients view



app.space.net: Networking PAPER:
	A good article on this subject: https://gafferongames.com/post/deterministic_lockstep/

	Some random buzz words:
		Deterministic lockstep
		snapshot
		delta update
		playout delay buffer
		adaptive playout delay



app.space: Simulation time control
	app.space: Pause, Unpause (It will be a good practise for timers and controls)
	app.space: Speed x1 x2 x4
	app.space: Speed hotkeys: 0,1,2,3 = set, space = toggle pause and last non pause speed

app.space: Cannibalize config.hpp from vm4_viewer (but maybe change it to CTRP, investigate it)











CI/CD:
	jenkins: pull
	jenkins: build (parameterized with branch and version number (and git commit count))
	jenkins: package
	jenkins: ssh upload the release package to the update master
	jenkins: trigger the update master
	update-master: by default every release marked as internal
	update-master: on some GUI mark this release not internal and mark update routes to be built
	jenkins could ping update-master on build start (option to auto release feature)


libv.ctrl: Box selection support
		start
			[press]
		update tick
			[hold]
		end
			[release]
libv.ctrl: Late enter of feature_binary: On context_enter call any binary feature that would become active with the current state

app.space: Simulation

app.space: Fleet merge/follow/attack commands
	app.space: 3D fleet picking
	app.space: Selected fleet highlight, hover fleet highlight
		app.space: edge highlight (fresnel shader) https://forum.playcanvas.com/t/solved-custom-shader-fresnel/17355

				8bit uint normalized to [+spread .. -spread]
			(There is also a newly found lib: https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen and https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdf-atlas-gen)
