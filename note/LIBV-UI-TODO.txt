--- STACK ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------














libv.ui: Style import other lua files for common variables
libv.ui: style script loading should match the way other resources are loaded
		No more: ui.load_style_script_file(wish::resource_path("res/style.lua"))

libv.ui: "State" property: focus-within
libv.ui: "State" property: nth (2nd 3rd is enough for now)


libv.ui: Adopt libv.re
libv.ui: Move libv.sun overlay_shader_error.hpp to ui





Tooltip
	libv.ui: Implement built-in support for child properties in BasePanel
	libv.ui: Cleanup child property access in Tooltip Container



Slider value change should not invalidate layout
	(make it a float region if it must)
	mouse context range remap might be needed!
libv.ui: Make sure that (only) position change does not invalidate layout


Slider Bar "hover" style/state: separate  for the track and for the bar


place.it: "Well behaved layout" flag bit could be also used for mouse events
libv.ui: Hover and focus styles state should be auto handled






Whaaaat, should be the size of scrollable lists?
	limit, parent -> 2 seperate size for layout2 env
	-1 size in a dim = no anchor or alignment in that dimension
	also, I need a back channel to fetch scroll area final virtual size


Another size type?
	S = Stretch
	S = Scroll
	F = Flow

	Upon encountering such an object, recurse into it without
	consideration to the size, but the issue is, size should be known
	before we call the object in case it need to be anchored/aligned
	in its parent and currently pos/size are mouse-region abs
		... unless we say, that flow objects just cannot be anchored
		... or unless scroll area just layouts like that
		...
	But... Long lists, I dont wanna precalc everything



Pagination
		Pagination support

		Pagination API
			dynamic change of max size of the components
				and that information should be traficed back to the scroll pane

			struct MyPagedEntryComponent {
				void on_screen();
				void off_screen();

				void assign(MyObject);
			};

			struct PaginationController {
				using entry = MyPagedEntryComponent;

				std::vector<float> entry_positions;
				libv::vec2f position;
				libv::vec2f size;

				libv::vec2f max_extent;
				libv::vec2f trigger_distance;

				int num_loaded;
				int num_keepalive;

				virtual void trigger_load();
				virtual void trigger_load(index);
				virtual void trigger_unload();
				virtual void trigger_seek();
				virtual void trigger_visible_area_changed();
			};

			Pagination<PaginationController, MyPagedEntryComponent> list;

			keep alive with a ring buffer

			on variable item sizes
				store/keep track of every item position that was already loaded
				1 float / item

			on fix item sized, jump around


		Pagination List Component

		But: Pagination != Scroll size solution






libv.ui: Scroll pane
	libv.ui: Implement scroll pane anchor behaviour
			anchor = "top-left"

	libv.ui: Ensure that scroll pane scrolling doent causes any layout invalidation
		if the content of the scroll area size is Dynamic then it causes a Dynamic
		layout query. Otherwise, its good

		content background is incorrect, bc content size in incorrect
			might be layout (-1) issue

		libv.ui: Scroll speed (user setting (3 line) and discovery (which font and which size))
				mouse scroll N line
				should scroll pane have a dummy font and font size just so it can have a config for "3 line"


libv.ui: Layout env size -1 support, everywhere... oh fork...
	limit, parent -> 2 seperate size for layout2 env

	-1 size in a dim = no anchor or alignment in that dimension

	also, I need a back channel to fetch scroll area final virtual size


libv.ui.SLC: BUG: line.assign_ratio_size is incorrect for:
		area 1r,1r vbar 25px,1r hbar 200px,25px









libv.ui: Make UI a global var, give it init/terminate function (or be implicit inside an UI ctor), kill current context misery

libv.ui.SLC: Add anchor support
libv.ui.SLC: Add alignment support
libv.ui.SLC: Add layers support (to support scroll pane with overlayed scroll bar)





----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


libv.ui: scroll_area only the "scroll pane" area without scroll bar
	libv.ui: scroll area layout
	libv.ui: scroll area render
	libv.ui: scroll area (mouse) control
	libv.ui: (?) scroll area size should equal or inherit(upward) it's content size
			issue: If I want a scroll plane size to be content, I have to set the plane, the area and the line
			idea: scroll area is not a component, but a component adaptor
				what is a component adaptor? How does it fit a component hierarchy, how does it alters the behaviours?
	libv.ui: container in scroll area, nested rendering alters clipping and control
	libv.ui: scroll area in scroll area, nested rendering alters clipping and control

	libv.ui: scroll area: request_scroll_to(pos, size) or request_display_of(pos, size)
	libv.ui: vec2 get_scroll_size() and use in use min(client.get_scroll_size, client.layout_size)

	idea: ui glsl component info: 1 uniform block and a single index into it as vertex attribute
			component bounds
			clip bounds
			| texture: id, layer, mode, bounds

	problem: composition of components to create complex components
		issue: create/attach/foreach/traverse/etc function implementations
		issue: pollutes component hierarchy
		issue: nested properties
		issue: scroll area size propagation: if content is 50% area has to be set to 50% and content to 100%, so the size rules are messed up | would be nice to not deal with this issue, but transparent wrapping

libv.ui: scroll_pane = client area + scroll bars
	libv.ui: clipping vertex shader (with on/off)
	libv.ui: shader clip plane (scissors), (effects every ui shader)
			| stencil could also be a solution, and it would be even better, more generic, non intrusive for the other shaders
			| or just use a viewport call and correct the projection matrix | would not allow 3D transforms
			| clip planes should be the most generic solution
	libv.ui: style sub component
	libv.ui: component position is currently relative to origin, once 'frame' and 'scroll' component comes in this will change
	libv.ui: mouse remapping regions and/or dimension and/or hubs to handle scroll panes and windows

libv.ui: Create a real scroll_bar = slider + buttons

libv.ui: Improve clipping
	libv.ui: Clip with scissor, fallback to stencil if someone want 3D UI
	libv.ui: Clip with stencil:
			ui init
				glEnable(GL_STENCIL_TEST);
				glStencilMask(0xFF);

			glStencilOp(GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP, GL_INCR);
			vertex only pass: GL_INCR the stencil on the clip region

			glStencilOp(GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP);
			glStencilFunc(GL_GEQUAL, clipDepth++, 0xFF)
			render every child

			glStencilOp(GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP, GL_DECR);
			vertex only pass: GL_DECR the stencil on the clip region

libv.ui: ctx.synthesize(T::handler_setter(&ToggleButton::state), ...

libv.ui: static_component system (lite)
	libv.ui: Check on the _pastebin/legacy codes for this one
	libv.ui: non-dynamic based panels, aka static_containers (no remove, only auto add)

libv.ui: To fix property init
		| scroll bar should not calculate any fucking layout in non layout
		| it does it so it can process mouse event
	libv.ui: Initialize every property in the constructor, or at least by the end of the ctor
	libv.ui: Do not cache bar bounds in value_* functions | or only cache if attached
	libv.ui: Do not use properties outside of callbacks, the values WILL BE incorrect

libv.ui.theme: Property substructure system example: https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/scene/doc-files/cssref.html#titledpane
		https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/scene/doc-files/cssref.html#titledpane

properties / style
	libv.ui.property: if fallback value is requested log a warning
	libv.ui.property: dynamic access
	libv.ui.property: solve name/type collusion
		libv.ui.style: either I centralize and static bind every property name to a single type OR i allow multiple different type/value under a single name
	libv.ui.style: Style Sheet / A proper default style or a way to auto assign styles to components would be nice (this is not property fallback, its style sheet fallback.)
	libv.ui.property: typed property registry
	libv.ui.property: optimize property reset: address could be used to lookup


====================================================================================================


libv.ui: 3D Anchor point layout (input camera) (For labels / UI Components over objects) (Most interesting stuff may happen in update or events)

libv.ui: Allow focus not yet attached components
libv.ui: Clicks into nothingness should clear focus
		| True, but define nothingness first
		| Callback/hook system for "unhandled" mouse click -> if noone would react to it -> clear focus

libv.ui: Font subpixel options: OFF RGB BGR

libv.ui: Stateify every UI component (minimal: hover and focus)
		label
		button
		input_field
		...

libv.ui: Stateify every UI component (extended: active (and selected))
		label
		button
		input_field
		...

libv.ui: Add missing button state switch on off component active release

libv.ui: border fragment = chained/nested background fragments (decorator pattern)

libv.ui: check on that "recent" modification that i just did in ui.context_state to start the frame time at now
	test time values at first frame



libv.ui: Style (resource) async loading
	if the style is used this frame: block
	otherwise load styles (and related resources) based on their priority (optional manual number during style definition) in the background
		resources with multiple priority uses the highest one
	1000: Loading screen
	 100: Main menu
	   0: Default
	-100: Rarely visited scenes (credits, settings)

libv.ui.property: scope / sheet / component type based style rules

libv.ui: Component Image, CheckBox, Slider(for bar) could have a foreground fragment too (layout 1 should switch to that size)

libv.ui: Background fragment
	libv.ui: background to_string's: "Not implemented yet";

	libv.ui: Implement getInnerContentBounds for every component
		DONE: label
		DONE: button
		DONE: input_field

	idea: Multiple fragment interaction?
			render background plane
			render borders (outer shadow/edge)
			render content
			render borders (inner shadow/edge)

libv.ui: Alignment justify should not 'start' at top left but from the orientation's starting point (therefore AlignVertical rate 1.0 for justifieds are incorrect)

libv.ui: Margin, Padding, Spacing and Alignment gaps
	libv.ui: Make panel_line margin not collapsing with padding
	libv.ui: Make panel_line alignment not considering padding region
	libv.ui: Make panel_anchor child margin push away border if there is not enough space
	libv.ui: padding support in every component (layout)
			scroll_bar | what is used in padding? The bar? | Most likely yes, the bar (bar could be replaced to component in future anyways)
	libv.ui: margin support in every component | margin only effects layouts, and considered outside of the component boundaries, so ratio and parent percent calculation should not include it
				panel_full DONE?
				panel_line (Partial)
				panel_anchor (Partial)
			panel_grid
			scroll_pane
			scroll_area
					label_image NO-OP
					button NO-OP
					check_box NO-OP
					image NO-OP
					input_field NO-OP
					label NO-OP
					quad NO-OP
					radio_button NO-OP
					scroll_bar NO-OP
					stretch NO-OP
	libv.ui: Document what Padding/Margin/Spacing is: (Maybe in a table form)
			OUTDATED collapse rules!
			? Interaction with border
			Padding:
				Part of the component but not part of the component's "content area"
				Part of the background
				Part of the size
				Part of the mouse region
				Does not collapses
			Margin:
				Not part of the component
				Not part of the background (Invisible)
				Not part of the size
				Not part of the mouse region
				Does collapses with neighboring Margin, Container spacing and container justify gap
			Spacing:
				Container mandated margin (only) between elements
				Not part of the background (Invisible)
				Not part of the component
				Not part of the size
				Not part of the mouse region
				Does collapses with neighboring Margin, Container spacing and container justify gap

Cleanup / Implement

place.it:
	cpp: Virtual inheritance can be a solution for base injection: All virtual base subobjects are initialized before any non-virtual base subobject, so only the most derived class calls the constructors of the virtual bases in its member initializer list:
			this can kill libv::net::detail::current_io_context
			investigate the runtime cost
			has memory overhead (I think it is merged with vtable ptr, so class already has one its zero)
	idea: bloom_filter usage if there is a 8/16/32 bit implementation of it: Component "signal"-iness per event type



--- Checkpoint ---



libv.ui/libv.ctrl: Keyboard binding display (For useful fun)

libv.ui: Storage system
	libv.ui: UI level storage system
			context().storage<UIUserConfig>() : UIUserConfig&
			should be accessible via UI too
	libv.ui: Component scoped storage system
			context().scoped_storage<FloatFrame>(label) : FloatFrame&
			should be accessible via UI too

libv.ui: UI based file watcher, libv.fsw > queue > ui loop event stage > broadcast
		should be accessible via UI too
		! There is one now for style script tracking, make it more ui-wise

libv.ui: adopt libv.rev's Shader and ShaderLoader

libv.ui: Fix layout invalidation up propagation possibility (remove access to flags, and provide mark functions)
		markInvalidLayout();
		| Also this logic might punches through floatRegion "layout barriers" that I dont think it should, or is that not a barrier?


--- Theme ---

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/TableView.html
table.setColumnResizePolicy(TableView.CONSTRAINED_RESIZE_POLICY);

imageHolder.minWidthProperty().bind(Bindings.createDoubleBinding(() ->
        scroll.getViewportBounds().getWidth(), scroll.viewportBoundsProperty()));
    grid.getChildren().add(imageHolder);



app.theme: use event_reentry_guard in control.slider.event().change
app.theme: create theme exporter: json and atlas texture

app.theme: connect the theme gen with a running app to live update
app.theme: clean up C++ blend/effect implementations

libv.ui: multithreading cooldown for ui frame iteration update callbacks. Aka: once_per_n_frame instead of X ms

glow falloff is incorrect on corners, find a better solution
	idea: it is 0-1 1-0: in the first range falloff should be a noop bc those values can be considered 1 AA
	libv.ui: Overlay zoom mouse hovered pixel color display
	| size = 0, falloff = 1 highlight perfectly the affected pixels

scroll bar change prompts layout, why? should it? | it does to recache the bar position

app.theme: --- PAPER ---
	So the way theme generation works (plan):
	- lua script containing the styles incl properties and the recepies for the atlases
	- running the lua script from C++ will generate the atlases and export it into an image and another lua script
	- from c++ ui run the generated lua script to acquire the theme
	- | NOPE
	- 	-> I will not generate lua from lua, that would not make sense, but what would make sense, is to generate a hash from the lua and if the hash matches the atlas...

libv.ui: set_clear_color (?) | no need, client could use a full background any time, but this means client has to clear
libv.ui: Button icon support (with left, top, down, right placement), if icon or text is not set, it is skipped

libv.ui: implement base_line alignment: most likely will need a vec2 get_base_line() function

libv.ui: observation: clip and scroll are two orthogonal features
		general concept: "floating" component that effects render, mouse, (layout)
		general concept: clip component that effects render, mouse, (layout)

libv.ui: current float region setting does not allows clean iteration and position determination of components, this is an issue. For example mouse and render behaviour are separated
libv.ui.layout:	verify what is going on with position change based layout invalidation in float region

libv.ui.layout: size over 100% is not an error

libv.ui: Make sure to invalidate flags after every child is iterated to prevent exception caused false unflagging
libv.ui: Clean up redundant shader codes and add run time (with shader recompile) to switch between debug clip and no clip

libv.ui: Idea: new raw texture, white with size of 1x1 px BUT on the getters it lies to 0x0 px so it would not effect layouts

libv.ui: The ui should not know about glr, except in shader, context_render code and maybe the overlays

libv.ui: overlay component layout stack highlight

libv.ui: check box
		Clickable elements with a cross in the middle that can be turned off or on.

libv.ui: radio_button and/or group
		https://github.com/cnjinhao/nana/blob/master/source/gui/widgets/checkbox.cpp
libv.ui: toggle (toggle button)

libv.ui: default style and theme set

libv.ui: card layout
libv.ui: progress bar | progress bar can have unknown max value, have a mode for it | 3 part: bg, bar, spark
libv.ui: list layout / component
libv.ui: table layout - only the columns and/or rows have size aka (more strict grid)
		An invisible container that lays out children in a specific number of columns. Column width is given by the largest element contained.
libv.ui: not owning container views (list and/or table)
libv.ui: progressbar
		Indicate progress by displaying a partially filled bar.



--- libv.ui MVP checkpoint ------------

libv.ui: Tooltips
		UI wide overlay
		Options:
			anchor:
				relative to mouse 1..9 corner
				relative to mouse no follow 1..9 corner
				relative to component 1..9 corner
				relative to screen 1..9 corner
				relative to callback (for 3D objects) 1..9 corner
			anchor clearance:
				left/right/bottom/top pixel count
				? could clearance be solved with tooltip component margin
			alignment:
				1..9 corner
			edge:
				(scroll pane) clipping space
				window
			edge behaviour (per axis):
				overhang
				clipped
				push in axis
				flip to opposite side
			issue: libv.ui: Card layout doesn't call detach when switching between tabs
			DONE issue: Tooltip doesnt relayout when owner relayouts

libv.ui: tab layout = card layout + header buttons
libv.ui: window
		contain other elements. They have a caption (and, just like flows, they lay out children either horizontally or vertically)

libv.ui: menu bar / menu / popup menu
libv.ui: separator / group (bordered and captioned)



--- libv.ui MVP+ checkpoint -----------



libv.ui: OverlayZoom use linearized zoom (like the Camera2 in vm4viewer)
libv.ui: OverlayZoom in control mode should scale "sensitivity" based on zoom

libv.ui: modernize every enum based property to match anchor's pattern: global table, to_string, operator<< | there will be another pass when UI gets dynamic property manipulation, like lists and such
		| use enum generator

libv.ui: Hide or remove CoreComponent usage from every API (like focus, AccessLayout)
libv.ui: Remove .core() usages wherever possible

libv.ui: icon button = background + image + text

libv.ui: InputMask for input field
		struct InputMask {
			virtual void insert(std::string& text, std::string_view insert, size_t insert_pos);
			virtual void remove(std::string& text, size_t remove_pos, size_t remove_size);
			// virtual std::string_view empty();
			// ...
		};

libv.ui: The UI Paper
	Core
			Core Component object containing every state of a given component, derived from CoreComponent
	Component / Handler
			Lightweight stateless handler object of a core component object, derived from Component
	Host
			Stateless event host

	Notes for the real scroll bar:
		double value; // current_line
		double value_low; // 0
		double value_high; // num_line
		double value_range; // num_lines_displayed

		double step_scroll; // [mouse wheel] 1 or 3 or settings.scroll_unit
		double step_button; // [button >] 1 or 3 or settings.scroll_unit
		double step_track; // [mouse button on track] 1 or 3 or settings.scroll_unit or inf
		double step_track_interval; // 0.3 or 1 or settings.step_button_hold_interval
		double step_button_hold; // [button > hold per interval] 1 or 3 or settings.scroll_unit
		double step_button_hold_interval; // 0.3 or 1 or settings.step_button_hold_interval
		double step_arrow; // [up/down] 1 or 3 or settings.scroll_unit
		double step_page; // [pageup/pagedown] num_lines_displayed

	Spacing / Margin / Padding

		TODO P5: ASCII diagram

		Spacing
			In a container space between elements (none on the outside borders, only between elements)
			It's a useful 'alias' for margins
			Space between elements

		Margin
			Space around an element

		Padding
			Space between the border and the content inside an element

	NOTES: fragments
		caption
		bg
		? fg

libv.ui: Idea for over restricted string_2D: if content would exceed limit, just push the lines or characters closer to each other (could be policy driven)

libv.ui: Idea: Zombie state, instead of keeping the dying component in their container move them into a ui global zombie land, they would still point to their parent, but their parent would no longer know about them
			zombie flag (rename / rework / reuse detach also works)
			change removal to be instant (or at least before/during layout step)
			first step of render is to render destroy all zombies
			and detach will just doDetach and remove every zombies from the ui global storage
		What does it solve?
			viewLayouted and viewRendered container management during layouts
			focusable also wins, no need to scan up for detaching parent | or at least traverse will skip obviously wrong candidates
			layout flag would no longer be required
		What issue could it cause?
			? Maaaaaybe something around expecting it inside parent, but, even that

libv.ui: Layout optimization: Some layout (like full and anchor) could handle layout invalidation independently, so if 1 child gets invalidated only that child gets to be relayouted

focus
	libv.ui.focus: Key/Hotkey events can trigger focus-traversal
	libv.ui.focus: easy way to trigger Focus traversal from events/components
	libv.ui.focus: by default unhandled [tab] hotkeys should trigger focus traversal
	libv.ui.focus: by default unhandled [esc] hotkeys should trigger focus clear
	libv.ui.focus: Ability to yield focus gain, when a component receives the onFocus (gain) event it would be nice to have a way to refusing it forcing it to travel further
	libv.ui.focus: Focus traversal order: direct link (ptr, ptr)
	libv.ui.focus: Focus-traversal needs a component hierarchy independent way to be defined, no raw id or index, use ptr/refs when direct setting it

	libv.ui.focus: Focus traversal order: layout driven (layout knows the orientation)
	libv.ui.focus: Focus traversal order: (index) position based

style
	libv.ui.style: (style exclusive / multiple) multiple style usage in a component would still be nice, maybe synthesized styles?

overlay
	libv.ui: generic orthogonal component level overlay system
		libv.ui: overlay ui errors/warnings: A generalized ui error report system (console with extras)

		libv.ui: overlay event freeze
			libv.ui: overlay event grab / multi-root / fake-root / overlay focus shaky
			libv.ui: overlay controls / mode switches / overlay mode display / overlay control display

		libv.ui: overlay zoom
			libv.ui: pixel distance measure / pixel region measure

		libv.ui: overlay cursor pixel highlight, coordinate display and mouse region stack display
		libv.ui: overlay magnifier (local zoom) (optionally slow mouse movement speed (freeze cursor with frame))
		libv.ui: overlay (mouse) stack display
		libv.ui: overlay component tree display
		libv.ui: overlay debug data stream, a context based output that can be written and displayed as a HUD

		libv.ui.property: hybrid reflection - dynamic
			libv.ui: detach should also be an event (mouse_table could utilize it to cleanup, debug observers could also use it)
				libv.ui: overlay property inspector (name it inspector)

		libv.ui: overlay resource viewer (textures, fonts, shaders (?))

lua
	libv.ui: lua binding | or rather a lua component or prototype parsing
	libv.ui: make sandbox_ui.lua work

libv.ui: include check everything / fwd everything
libv.ui: statistics: each ui operation (attach, style, render, ...) histogram, min, max, count | maybe not store, only give an option to log the current values each frame, maybe with a default stat collector

libv.ui: 2Dify UI: layout only makes sense in 2D, this does not forbids 3D element nor 3D layers nor 3D positions, but layouts makes no sense in 3D 99.99% of the cases | positions are 3D sizes are 2D and maybe 3D normals (?) | normal is not necessary per component, its enough to have one on the "tilting" container

libv.ui: font failure to load means fallback | verify
libv.ui: shader failure to load means fallback | verify
libv.ui: shader dynamic loading from file

libv.ui.font: fallback to Unicode Character 'REPLACEMENT CHARACTER' (U+FFFD) | add it back to fallback consolas_min font | https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/fffd/index.htm
libv.ui.font: fallback to ascii '?'
libv.ui.font: fallback to simple square (render the not found character by 'hand')
libv.ui.font: https://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/tutorial/step2.html
libv.ui.font: We do not check the error code returned by FT_Get_Kerning. This is because the function always sets the content of delta to (0,0) if an error occurs.

libv.ui: String2D scream at the user if the API get a \r (or any non printable character beside \n \t), and ignore it

libv.ui.event: slot / signal flags could be unflagged if a disconnect leaves an empty entry in the event context




=== PAPERS ========================================================================================


Alternatives:
		--- elements ---
		https://github.dev/cycfi/elements
			Composition and properties are based on a decorator pattern

		Observations:

		composition:
			elements achieves good composition by a decorator pattern
			in case of composite components (like slider) it uses memory local storage
				with virtual functions to access parts
				virtual & rail

		elements have no property system, everything is composed via a decorator pattern

		--- nana ---

			Great event system API




PAPER: Re-entering event loop problem and solution:
	Solution event_reentry_guard:
		On every call execute 2 step:
			- Test Target. If it fails abort early
			- Lock Source

	Example:
		// In the ui -> model event handler:
		const auto reentry_guard = input.event_reentry_guard(source_component.ptr(), &target_model);
		if (!reentry_guard)
			return;

		// In the model -> ui event handler:
		const auto reentry_guard = input.event_reentry_guard(&source_model, target_component.ptr());
		if (!reentry_guard)
			return;



PAPER: Component styled states:
		Possible states:
			Button
				 Disabled : Normal : Hover : Focus : Active(Pressing) : Progress : Done/Error

			Input Field
				 Disabled : Normal : Hover : Focus

			Slider
				 Disabled : Normal : Hover : Focus : Active(Dragging)

		- states are independent
			bit-mask
			limited number of state (max 32)
			state names has to assigned to a unique int

		- state def in style sheet
				ui.style("style.name") {
					properties...

					state("[!]state{, [!]state}") {
						conditional properties...
					}
				}

		- overriding: in case of multiple definition of the same property the last with matching state wins

		- inheritance: If the requested property is not found the parents will be searched recursively



PAPER: SLC - Static Layout Composition
	Node input / output:
		area_size: The full size of the area that the node should consider
			- For pixel / percent its the full conainer size
			- For dynamic its the maximum limit the node could use (including its current reserverarion)
			- For ratio its the exact new size (determined by ratio) of the node
		return: Change in reservation in the area

	Rules:
		Pixel size:
			Fix size in pixels
		Percent size:
			Percent size of the parent excluding the padding
		Dynamic size:
			Limit = assume every future dynamic is empty
			Can "reuse" space already allocated by the objects fix size
		Ratio size:
			Distribute any unused space between nodes based on their ratio
