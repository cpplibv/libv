libv.ui: Add component access to relative mouse position
libv.ui: relative - mouse event should contain a watcher relative (local) coordinates too | they already did
libv.ui: Relative mouse coordinate access for a state
libv.ui: Panel Status Log (aka first composite component) | It ended up being something else
libv.ui: Layout testing

--- STACK ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------








libv.ui: Margin, Padding, Spacing and Alignment gaps
	libv.ui: Document what Padding/Margin/Spacing is: (Maybe in a table form)
			? Interaction with border
			Padding:
				Part of the component but not part of the component 'content area'
				Part of the background
				Part of the size
				Part of the mouse region
				Does not collapses
			Margin:
				Not part of the component
				Not part of the background (Invisible)
				Not part of the size
				Not part of the mouse region
				Does collapses with neighboring Margin, Container spacing and container justify gap
			Spacing:
				Container mandated margin (only) between elements
				Not part of the background (Invisible)
				Not part of the component
				Not part of the size
				Not part of the mouse region
				Does collapses with neighboring Margin, Container spacing and container justify gap
	libv.ui: Make panel_line margin not collapsing with padding
	libv.ui: Make panel_line alignment not considering padding region
	libv.ui: Make panel_float child margin push away border if there is not enough space
	libv.ui: margin support in every component | margin only effects layouts, and considered outside of the component boundaries, so ratio and parent percent calculation should not include it
				panel_full DONE?
				panel_line (Partial)
				panel_float (Partial)
			panel_grid
			scroll_pane
			scroll_area
					label_image NO-OP
					button NO-OP
					check_box NO-OP
					image NO-OP
					input_field NO-OP
					label NO-OP
					quad NO-OP
					radio_button NO-OP
					scroll_bar NO-OP
					stretch NO-OP
	libv.ui: padding support in every component (layout)
			scroll_bar | what is used in padding? The bar? | Most likely yes, the bar (bar could be replaced to component in future anyways)

libv.ui: static_component system (lite)
	Check on the _pastebin/legacy codes for this one
	libv.ui: Restructure: property context creation stuffy simplification
			maybe CRTP base for core components
			| if core_component gets a CRTP base also implement virtual function overload detection idiom with it
	libv.ui: non-dynamic based panels, aka static_containers (no remove, only auto add)
	libv.ui: Composite component style / property system
		libv.ui.property: complex composite component would result in "nested" property sets
		libv.ui.property: property system interaction with static_component system
		libv.ui.event: Composite components internal behaviour should be events that are hooked up in ctor with connect_unignorable_front

libv.ui: Background fragment, property type that can be quad/image/stretch/paramed_stretch/gradient with color/shader/params
	background
		anchor point
		repeat, stretch, flexpoint

	libv.ui.render:	bg.render(pos, size, ?padding, ?...)
			render background plane
			render borders (outer shadow/edge)
			render component
			render borders (inner shadow/edge)

	libv.ui: In every component background should not contribute to layout1 size

libv.ui: THE SOLUTION to event shared state loop back is: initiator pointer (or initiator stack)
		A simple const void* that can be passed to any function that can produce a event
			(or in case of a stack a ui global stack of const void*)
		Not a 100% fool prof, but it 99.9% will do just fine, in case if its not, custom logic will do
		if (label.ui().event_initiator_check_loop(&shared_state))
		if (event.check_initiator_loop(&shared_state))
			return;
		Implement in: app.theme: control.slider.event().change

libv.ui: Restructure: contexts, centralize and unify them, their construction, their referencing, improve naming (event -> comm)
		organize which is public (like context_state), which is privet (like context_event)

Cleanup / Implement
	src/libv/ui/component/base_panel_static.*
	src/libv/ui/component/check_box.*
	src/libv/ui/component/file_picker.*
	src/libv/ui/component/radio_button.*
	src/libv/ui/component/radio_group.*

place.it:
	cpp: Virtual inheritance can be a solution for base injection: All virtual base subobjects are initialized before any non-virtual base subobject, so only the most derived class calls the constructors of the virtual bases in its member initializer list:
			this can kill libv::net::detail::current_io_context
			investigate the runtime cost
			has memory overhead (I think it is merged with vtable ptr, so class already has one its zero)
	idea: bloom_filter usage if there is a 8/16/32 bit implementation of it: Component "signal"-iness per event type



--- Checkpoint ---



libv.ui/libv.ctrl: Keyboard binding display (For useful fun)

libv.ui: UI level storage system
		context().storage<UIUserConfig>() : UIUserConfig&
		should be accessible via UI too
	libv.ui: Component scoped storage system
			context().scoped_storage<FloatFrame>(label) : FloatFrame&
			should be accessible via UI too

libv.ui: UI based file watcher, libv.fsw > queue > ui loop event stage > broadcast
		should be accessible via UI too

libv.ui: check on that recent modification that i just did in ui.context_state to start the frame time at now
	test time values at first frame

libv.ui: adopt libv.rev's Shader and ShaderLoader

libv.ui: (?) Rename PanelFloat to PanelAnchor

libv.ui: Fix layout invalidation up propagation possibility (remove access to flags, and provide mark functions)
		markInvalidLayout();
		| Also this logic might punches through floatRegion "layout barriers" that I dont think it should, or is that not a barrier?


--- Theme ---




https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/TableView.html
table.setColumnResizePolicy(TableView.CONSTRAINED_RESIZE_POLICY);

imageHolder.minWidthProperty().bind(Bindings.createDoubleBinding(() ->
        scroll.getViewportBounds().getWidth(), scroll.viewportBoundsProperty()));
    grid.getChildren().add(imageHolder);



app.theme: create theme exporter: json and atlas texture

app.theme: connect the theme gen with a running app to live update
app.theme: clean up C++ blend/effect implementations

libv.ui: multithreading cooldown for ui frame iteration. Aka: once_per_n_frame instead of X ms

libv.ui: To fix property init
		| scroll bar should not calculate any fucking layout in non layout
		| it does it so it can process mouse event
	libv.ui: Initialize every property in the constructor, or at least by the end of the ctor
	libv.ui: Do not cache bar bounds in value_* functions | or only cache if attached
	libv.ui: Do not use properties outside of callbacks, the values WILL BE incorrect


glow falloff is incorrect on corners, find a better solution
	idea: it is 0-1 1-0: in the first range falloff should be a noop bc those values can be considered 1 AA
	libv.ui: Overlay zoom mouse hovered pixel color display
	| size = 0, falloff = 1 highlight perfectly the affected pixels

scroll bar change prompts layout, why? should it? | it does to recache the bar position

app.theme: --- PAPER ---
	So the way theme generation works (plan):
	- lua script containing the styles incl properties and the recepies for the atlases
	- running the lua script from C++ will generate the atlases and export it into an image and another lua script
	- from c++ ui run the generated lua script to acquire the theme
	- | NOPE
	- 	-> I will not generate lua from lua, that would not make sense, but what would make sense, is to generate a hash from the lua and if the hash matches the atlas...


libv.ui.theme: UI system need a system to communicate states to the style system, like hover, pressed, etc...
libv.ui.theme: Property substructure system example: https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/scene/doc-files/cssref.html#titledpane
		https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/scene/doc-files/cssref.html#titledpane
		https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/scene/doc-files/cssref.html#textfield
		https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/scene/doc-files/cssref.html#typeeffect



libv.ui: set_clear_color (?) | no need, client could use a full background any time, but this means client has to clear
libv.ui: Button icon support (with left, top, down, right placement), if icon or text is not set, it is skipped


libv.ui.theme:
	Button states:
		Normal
		Focus
		Hover
		Active/Press
		Progress/Loading
		Disabled
		Error


libv.ui: implement base_line alignment: most likely will need a vec2 get_base_line() function
libv.ui: scroll area: request_scroll_to(pos, size) or request_display_of(pos, size)
libv.ui: vec2 get_scroll_size() and use in use min(client.get_scroll_size, client.layout_size)

libv.ui: observation: clip and scroll are two orthogonal features
		general concept: "floating" component that effects render, mouse, (layout)
		general concept: clip component that effects render, mouse, (layout)

libv.ui: current float region setting does not allows clean iteration and position determination of components, this is an issue. For example mouse and render behaviour are separated
libv.ui.layout:	verify what is going on with position change based layout invalidation in float region

libv.ui.layout: size over 100% is not an error

libv.ui: make access_property a class member function (or use a single composite param)



libv.ui: Make sure to invalidate flags after every child is iterated to prevent exception caused false unflagging
libv.ui: Clean up redundant shader codes and add run time (with shader recompile) to switch between debug clip and no clip
libv.ui: Fragments:
		also, render fragments in on "bundle"
			r.quad({0, 0}, layout_size2(), {0, 0}, {1, 1}, property.background());
			r.text(padding_LB(), text_, property.font());

libv.ui: Make sure that (only) position change does not invalidates layout

libv.ui: Idea: new raw texture, white with size of 1x1 px BUT on the getters it lies to 0x0 px so it would not effect layouts

libv.ui: The ui should not know about glr, except in shader, context_render code and maybe the overlays

libv.ui: overlay component layout stack highlight




libv.ui: scroll_area only the "scroll pane" area without scroll bar
	libv.ui: scroll area layout
	libv.ui: scroll area render
	libv.ui: scroll area (mouse) control
	libv.ui: (?) scroll area size should equal or inherit(upward) it's content size
			issue: If I want a scroll plane size to be content, I have to set the plane, the area and the line
			idea: scroll area is not a component, but a component adaptor
				what is a component adaptor? How does it fit a component hierarchy, how does it alters the behaviours?
	libv.ui: container in scroll area, nested rendering alters clipping and control
	libv.ui: scroll area in scroll area, nested rendering alters clipping and control

	idea: ui glsl component info: 1 uniform block and a single index into it as vertex attribute
			component bounds
			clip bounds

	problem: composition of components to create complex components
		issue: create/attach/foreach/traverse/etc function implementations
		issue: pollutes component hierarchy
		issue: nested properties
		issue: scroll area size propagation: if content is 50% area has to be set to 50% and content to 100%, so the size rules are messed up | would be nice to not deal with this issue, but transparent wrapping


	ComponentHandler and EventHost should be "separated" to allow inheritance chains with different EventHosts

	ideas and notes
		new component memory models allows unlimited templates
		component decorator
		component that can be "hidden" in the component hierarchy but still function (aka a quick and dirty implementation of decorator)



libv.ui: scroll_pane = client area + scroll bar
	libv.ui: clipping vertex shader (with on/off)
	libv.ui: shader clip plane (scissors), (effects every ui shader)
			| stencil could also be a solution, and it would be even better, more generic, non intrusive for the other shaders
			| or just use a viewport call and correct the projection matrix | would not allow 3D transforms
			| clip planes should be the most generic solution
	libv.ui: style sub component
	libv.ui: component position is currently relative to origin, once 'frame' and 'scroll' component comes in this will change
	libv.ui: mouse remapping regions and/or dimension and/or hubs to handle scroll panes and windows

libv.ui: rename scroll bar to slider
libv.ui: rename scroll bar (slider) value_min and value_max to value_low and value_high
libv.ui: create a real scroll_bar = slider + buttons

libv.ui: check box
		Clickable elements with a cross in the middle that can be turned off or on.

libv.ui: radio_button and/or group
		https://github.com/cnjinhao/nana/blob/master/source/gui/widgets/checkbox.cpp
libv.ui: toggle (toggle button)

libv.ui: default style and theme set

libv.ui: card layout
libv.ui: progress bar | progress bar can have unknown max value, have a mode for it | 3 part: bg, bar, spark
libv.ui: list layout / component
libv.ui: table layout - only the columns and/or rows have size aka (more strict grid)
		An invisible container that lays out children in a specific number of columns. Column width is given by the largest element contained.
libv.ui: not owning container views (list and/or table)
libv.ui: progressbar
		Indicate progress by displaying a partially filled bar.



--- libv.ui MVP checkpoint ------------



libv.ui: tab layout = card layout + header buttons
libv.ui: window
		contain other elements. They have a caption (and, just like flows, they lay out children either horizontally or vertically)
libv.ui: popup / tooltip
		? tooltip is a layout
		Its possilbe to implement tooltip container with hierarchy, context.storage.treeget/treeset could use that
		context().tooltip(Component, tooltip_for_pos, tooltip_for_size, preferred_corner)
libv.ui: menu bar / menu / popup menu
libv.ui: separator / group (bordered and captioned)



--- libv.ui MVP+ checkpoint -----------



libv.ui: OverlayZoom use linearized zoom (like the Camera2 in vm4viewer)
libv.ui: OverlayZoom in control mode should scale "sensitivity" based on zoom

libv.ui: modernize every enum based property to match anchor's pattern: global table, to_string, operator<< | there will be another pass when UI gets dynamic property manipulation, like lists and such
libv.ui: Remove the half manual - half automated public property access (this might remove the whole AccessProperty | not really, but still a cleanup that is worth it)

libv.ui: content property.hpp can be more hidden toward components (Especially the variant)
libv.ui: Hide or remove CoreComponent usage from every API (like focus, AccessLayout)
libv.ui: Remove .core() usages wherever possible

libv.ui: icon button = background + image + text

libv.ui: InputMask for input field
		struct InputMask {
			virtual void insert(std::string& text, std::string_view insert, size_t insert_pos);
			virtual void remove(std::string& text, size_t remove_pos, size_t remove_size);
			// virtual std::string_view empty();
			// ...
		};

libv.ui: The UI Paper
	Core
			Core Component object containing every state of a given component, derived from CoreComponent
	Component / Handler
			Lightweight stateless handler object of a core component object, derived from Component
	Host
			Stateless event host

	Notes for the real scroll bar:
		double value; // current_line
		double value_min; // 0
		double value_max; // num_line
		double value_range; // num_lines_displayed

		double step_scroll; // [mouse wheel] 1 or 3 or settings.scroll_unit
		double step_button; // [button >] 1 or 3 or settings.scroll_unit
		double step_track; // [mouse button on track] 1 or 3 or settings.scroll_unit or inf
		double step_track_interval; // 0.3 or 1 or settings.step_button_hold_interval
		double step_button_hold; // [button > hold per interval] 1 or 3 or settings.scroll_unit
		double step_button_hold_interval; // 0.3 or 1 or settings.step_button_hold_interval
		double step_arrow; // [up/down] 1 or 3 or settings.scroll_unit
		double step_page; // [pageup/pagedown] num_lines_displayed

	Spacing
		In a container space between elements (none on the outside borders, only between elements)
		Its a very useful 'alias' for margins

	Margin
		space between elements
		always collapses with neighbouring margins (? and spacings)
			(?) except respects negative

	Padding
		space between border and content

	NOTES: fragments
		caption
		bg
		? fg

libv.ui: Idea for over restricted string_2D: if content would exceed limit, just push the lines or characters closer to each other (could be policy driven)

libv.ui: Idea: Zombie state, instead of keeping the dying component in their container move them into a ui global zombie land, they would still point to their parent, but their parent would no longer know about them
			zombie flag (rename / rework / reuse detach also works)
			change removal to be instant (or at least before/during layout step)
			first step of render is to render destroy all zombies
			and detach will just doDetach and remove every zombies from the ui global storage
		What does it solve?
			viewLayouted and viewRendered container management during layouts
			focusable also wins, no need to scan up for detaching parent | or at least traverse will skip obviously wrong candidates
			layout flag would no longer be required
		What issue could it cause?
			? Maaaaaybe something around expecting it inside parent, but, even that

	libv.ui: cleanup context_ui redundant codes

	libv.ui.ctrl: ui.text.select-word-right = ctrl+shift+right
	libv.ui.ctrl: ui.redo = ctrl+[y] // logical y key
	libv.ui.ctrl: ui.undo = ctrl+[z] // logical z key
	libv.ui.ctrl: ui.redo-non-destructive // emacs style redo, not the default
	libv.ui.ctrl: ui.undo-non-destructive // emacs style undo, not the default

focus
	libv.ui.focus: Key/Hotkey events can trigger focus-traversal
	libv.ui.focus: easy way to trigger Focus traversal from events/components
	libv.ui.focus: by default unhandled [tab] hotkeys should trigger focus traversal
	libv.ui.focus: by default unhandled [esc] hotkeys should trigger focus clear
	libv.ui.focus: Ability to yield focus gain, when a component receives the onFocus (gain) event it would be nice to have a way to refusing it forcing it to travel further
	libv.ui.focus: Focus traversal order: direct link (ptr, ptr)
	libv.ui.focus: Focus-traversal needs a component hierarchy independent way to be defined, no raw id or index, use ptr/refs when direct setting it

	libv.ui.focus: Focus traversal order: layout driven (layout knows the orientation)
	libv.ui.focus: Focus traversal order: (index) position based

style
	libv.ui: style sheets | aka themes
	libv.ui: lua style parsing and lua file tracking with auto re-style | only style parsing
	libv.ui.style: (style exclusive / multiple) multiple style usage in a component would still be nice, maybe synthetized styles?

overlay
	libv.ui: generic orthogonal component level overlay system
		libv.ui: overlay ui errors/warnings: A generalized ui error report system (console with extras)

		libv.ui: overlay event freeze
			libv.ui: overlay event grab / multi-root / fake-root / overlay focus shaky
			libv.ui: overlay controls / mode switches / overlay mode display / overlay control display

		libv.ui: overlay zoom
			libv.ui: pixel distance measure / pixel region measure

		libv.ui: overlay cursor pixel highlight, coordinate display and mouse region stack display
		libv.ui: overlay magnifier (local zoom) (optionally slow mouse movement speed (freeze cursor with frame))
		libv.ui: overlay (mouse) stack display
		libv.ui: overlay component tree display
		libv.ui: overlay debug data stream, a context based output that can be written and displayed as a HUD

		libv.ui.property: hybrid reflection - dynamic
			libv.ui: detach should also be an event (mouse_table could utilize it to cleanup, debug observers could also use it)
				libv.ui: overlay property inspector (name it inspector)

		libv.ui: overlay resource viewer (textures, fonts, shaders (?))

lua
	libv.ui: lua binding | or rather a lua component or prototype parsing
	libv.ui: make sandbox_ui.lua work

libv.ui: include check everything / fwd everything
libv.ui: statistics: each ui operation (attach, style, render, ...) histogram, min, max, count | maybe not store, only give an option to log the current values each frame, maybe with a default stat collector

libv.ui: 2Dify UI: layout only makes sense in 2D, this does not forbids 3D element nor 3D layers nor 3D positions, but layouts makes no sense in 3D 99.99% of the cases | positions are 3D sizes are 2D and maybe 3D normals (?) | normal is not necessary per component, its enough to have one on the "tilting" container

libv.ui: font failure to load means fallback | verify
libv.ui: shader failure to load means fallback | verify
libv.ui: shader dynamic loading from file

libv.ui.font: fallback to Unicode Character 'REPLACEMENT CHARACTER' (U+FFFD) | add it back to fallback consolas_min font | https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/fffd/index.htm
libv.ui.font: fallback to ascii '?'
libv.ui.font: fallback to simple square (render the not found character by 'hand')
libv.ui.font: https://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/tutorial/step2.html
libv.ui.font: We do not check the error code returned by FT_Get_Kerning. This is because the function always sets the content of delta to (0,0) if an error occurs.

libv.ui: String2D scream at the user if the API get a \r (or any non printable character beside \n \t), and ignore it

libv.ui.event: slot / signal flags could be unflagged if a disconnect leaves an empty entry in the event context
