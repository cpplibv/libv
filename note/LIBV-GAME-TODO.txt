app.space: Improve arrow with geometry shader


app.space: Add grid
app.space: Add multi camera / camera frustum visualization



visual.grid: Make a pretty grid: Blender grid is awesome. Implement it:
visual.grid: For grids expand and fade out line endings
visual.grid: For grids fade out lines based on ray incident angle, lines should fade into the sky-box as seamlessly as possible
visual.grid: For grids fade out small lines based on distance from the camera and make higher grid lines more visible
visual.editor_bg: Non uniform color, use a grainy texture (like blue noise)

What do I need from libv to make a 'minimal' working iris program?

	libv.update
		Resource
			1 Working resource download protocol
			1 Update/Resource signature verification
		Working update
			1 Self update support
			1 Marry Resource and Update
		Deployment
			2 Scripts to create a new build and deploy to libv.update servers

	libv.security
		1 public / private key signature checking

	libv.serial
		1 safe container resize/reserve

	libv.ui
		1 background generalization
		2 style lua loader
		2 list component
		3 scroll pane = scroll area + scroll bar + connecting them
		3 container spacing property
		4 button states (state styles)
		5 font outline render





iris: Make a main menu


blur: (shaders are already implemented in app.space, but downscaling is not) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZlwbWqQKpc
		full screen quad pass with render_resolution / 2 with v blur shader
		full screen quad pass with render_resolution / 2 with h blur shader
		full screen quad pass with render_resolution / 8 with v blur shader
		full screen quad pass with render_resolution / 8 with h blur shader
