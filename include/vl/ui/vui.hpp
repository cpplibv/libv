#pragma once

// Trace - Only when I would be "tracing" the code and trying to find one part of a function specifically
// Debug - Information that is diagnostically helpful to people more than just developers (IT, sysadmins, etc)
// Info - Generally useful information to log (service start/stop, configuration assumptions, etc). Info I want to always have available but usually dont care about under normal circumstances. This is my out-of-the-box config level
// Notif - 
// Warn - Anything that can potentially cause application oddities, but for which I am automatically recoverring (such as switching from a primary to backup server, retrying an operation, missing secondary data, etc)
// Error - Any error which is fatal to the operation but not the service or application (cant open a required file, missing data, etc). These errors will force user (administrator, or direct user) intervention. These are usually reserved (in my apps) for incorrect connection strings, missing services, etc.
// Fatal - Any error that is forcing a shutdown of the service or application to prevent data loss (or further data loss). I reserve these only for the most heinous errors and situations where there is guaranteed to have been data corruption or loss.
