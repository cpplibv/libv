// Performs 'discrete online rectangle packing into a rectangular bin' by maintaining
//	a binary tree of used and free rectangles of the bin. There are several variants
//	of bin packing problems, and this packer is characterized by:
//	- We're solving the 'online' version of the problem, which means that when we're adding
//	  a rectangle, we have no information of the sizes of the rectangles that are going to
//	  be packed after this one.
//	- We are packing rectangles that are not rotated. I.e. the algorithm will not flip
//	  a rectangle of (w,h) to be stored if it were a rectangle of size (h, w). There is no
//	  restriction conserning UV mapping why this couldn't be done to achieve better
//	  occupancy, but it's more work. Feel free to try it out.
//	- The packing is done in discrete integer coordinates and not in rational/real numbers (floats).
//	Internal memory usage is linear to the number of rectangles we've already packed.
//
//	Idea: Instead of just picking the first free rectangle to insert the new rect into,
//	      check all free ones (or maintain a sorted order) and pick the one that minimizes
//			the resulting leftover area. There is no real reason to maintain a tree - in fact
//			it's just redundant structuring. We could as well have two lists - one for free
//			rectangles and one for used rectangles. This method would be faster and might
//			even achieve a considerably better occupancy rate.
